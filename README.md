# Overdrop iOS Issues
Repo for Overdrop issues tracking (iOS-only)

Here you can request new features and report bug fixes!

For Android issues, please report them at the [Android repository](https://github.com/deno750/Overdrop-Issues).

Just go to the [Issues](https://github.com/deno750/Overdrop-ios-Issues/issues) section, search if what you asking for is already asked. If not, click on "New issue", add an appropriate title and write a detailed description (if possible). Mark the issue with the label "bug" if the issue is a bug report, and "enhanchement"
for new features and so on...
